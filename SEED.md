# Creative coding projects

Here is an example of a creative coding project:
It was realized for the Chilean band Ángel De La Guarda (@angeldelxguarda) for their album "Alfanumerico". The work here consisted in a reinterpretation of 3D models realized with drones and photometry techniques. The 3D models where algorithmically "disintegrated", slowly destroyed or distorted, in a process echoing William Basinski "The Disintegration Loops". The result can be seen at https://www.interfaz.cloud/. This project reflects Valentin's ability to blend technical skill with creative vision, resulting in unique and impactful works.
